OpenAI Expands ChatGPT Memory Feature to More Users on Mobile and Desktop

OpenAI continues to revolutionize the user experience with **ChatGPT** by significantly expanding its memory feature. This update, now available to a larger number of users on mobile and desktop platforms, allows the AI to remember user preferences and details from past conversations, eliminating the need to repeat context in every interaction. The result: a more personalized and efficient experience.

### Update Details

According to a recent report from _Testing Catalog_ [^1], the enhanced memory feature, internally known as "Moonshine," has been gradually rolled out to both free users and Plus subscribers. This tool enables ChatGPT to store relevant interaction details, such as personal preferences or recurring topics, and utilize them in future dialogues. Additionally, users have the flexibility to enable or disable this feature from the Settings menu, ensuring greater control over their privacy and data.

### Updates by Platform

The implementation of this upgrade varies slightly by device:

- **iOS**: Users without an account can perform basic searches, but advanced features like Thinking and Voice Mode require login. Memory is available for all user levels once activated.
- **macOS**: The beta app introduces a redesigned interface with a white background and new persistent tiles for image creation and canvas, distinct from traditional slash commands. New options to disable autocomplete and trending searches have also been added, optimizing the user experience.

These updates reflect OpenAI’s commitment to adapting ChatGPT to the specific needs of each platform while maintaining an intuitive and functional interface.

### Conclusion

The expansion of the **ChatGPT** memory feature marks a significant step forward in integrating artificial intelligence into our daily lives. By offering smoother and more personalized interactions, OpenAI is not only enhancing usability but also opening new possibilities for personal and professional applications. While there are still discussions about the official name of this feature, users can expect further official announcements from the company to clarify details. For now, this update signals a clear vision for the future of conversational AI.
