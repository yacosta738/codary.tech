## What is the "whoAMI" attack?

Cybersecurity researchers have revealed a new attack technique called "whoAMI," which exploits name confusion in Amazon Machine Images (AMI) to execute code remotely in Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts. This vulnerability takes advantage of the way some developers search for and select AMIs without properly specifying ownership parameters.

The attack works when an attacker publishes an AMI with a name that matches the search criteria used by developers. If they do not properly filter the results, they may end up using a malicious AMI in their EC2 instances, enabling remote code execution within their AWS environment.

## Impact and Scope

Seth Art, a researcher at Datadog Security Labs, warns that "if executed on a large scale, this attack could be used to gain access to thousands of AWS accounts." The research found that this vulnerability pattern is present in numerous code repositories, both private and open-source, which amplifies its risk.

## AWS Response

AWS was notified of the issue on September 16, 2024, and addressed the vulnerability three days later. According to the company, there is no evidence that the technique has been maliciously exploited in a real-world environment. In a statement, AWS said:

> "All AWS services are operating as designed. Based on a thorough analysis of logs and monitoring, our investigation confirmed that the described technique has only been executed by authorized researchers, with no evidence of use by other parties."

## Mitigation Measures

To mitigate this risk, AWS has introduced a new setting called "Allowed AMIs," which allows administrators to restrict the discovery and use of AMIs within their accounts. Customers are advised to evaluate and implement this security measure.

Additionally, HashiCorp Terraform has taken action. In version 5.77.0 of its AWS provider, a warning has been added for users who use `most_recent = true` without an owner filter. This warning is expected to become a mandatory error in version 6.0.0.

## Conclusion

The "whoAMI" attack highlights the importance of properly defining parameters when selecting AMIs and implementing adequate security controls in AWS environments. Companies and developers should adopt measures such as verifying AMI ownership and configuring allowed AMI lists to prevent potential attacks.
