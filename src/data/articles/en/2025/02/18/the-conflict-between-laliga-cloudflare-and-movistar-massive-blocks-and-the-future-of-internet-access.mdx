The conflict between LaLiga, Cloudflare, and Movistar has triggered a series of massive blocks affecting thousands of users and legitimate businesses in Spain. This dispute, aimed at combating sports content piracy, has had unintended consequences that threaten net neutrality and free access to the Internet.

## **The Origin of the Conflict**

The conflict began when LaLiga requested that several Internet service providers, including Movistar, block IP addresses associated with illegal platforms that stream football matches without authorization. However, these IP addresses are shared by multiple legitimate services using Cloudflare, a company that provides security and optimization for many websites.

> LaLiga has the authority to order the blocking through two court rulings from 2022. [^1]

## **Impact on Users and Businesses**

Blocking these IP addresses has resulted in service disruptions, affecting businesses and users who have no connection to piracy. Thousands of companies have reported significant financial losses due to their inability to access their websites or conduct online transactions.

> Thousands of Spanish businesses have been affected by a measure taken by Movistar, at LaLiga's request, to combat illegal football broadcasts. [^2]

## **Reactions and Legal Measures**

The situation has created an atmosphere of distrust between users and their Internet providers. Cloudflare has accused LaLiga of acting deliberately, knowing the consequences of its actions. Meanwhile, LaLiga has opened a channel for affected users to report issues, although it insists that its measures are necessary to combat piracy.

> LaLiga has made it clear that it does not intend to stop these actions and has hinted that the blocking of Cloudflare is part of a strategy to directly target the company. [^3]

## **The Future of Internet Access**

The conflict raises serious questions about the future of Internet access and net neutrality. The measures taken by LaLiga and Movistar could set a dangerous precedent, allowing indiscriminate blocks that affect legitimate services. It is crucial that the relevant authorities investigate and ensure that these actions are proportional and justified.
