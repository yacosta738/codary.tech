Cloudflare has taken legal action against LaLiga over the indiscriminate blocking of IP addresses, which is affecting thousands of legitimate websites. This measure, aimed at combating illegal football match streaming, has had significant collateral effects, disrupting access to numerous services and web pages unrelated to illicit activities.

## **The Conflict Between Cloudflare and LaLiga**

The conflict between Cloudflare and LaLiga has intensified in recent weeks, with LaLiga ordering ISPs to temporarily block shared IP addresses belonging to Cloudflare. These blocks, intended to curb illegal streaming, have affected millions of users and businesses, preventing them from accessing thousands of websites during sporting events.

> Since early February, LaLiga has taken the drastic measure of temporarily blocking shared IP addresses belonging to Cloudflare. This action, intended to stop illegal football match streaming, has caused significant collateral damage: millions of users and businesses have been affected, losing access to thousands of websites during sporting events.

## **Impact on Users and Businesses**

The scale of this issue has sparked intense debate about the legality and proportionality of LaLiga’s actions. Some users have found alternative ways to access blocked websites, such as using VPNs, but this does not address the underlying problem. Cloudflare argues that the blocking measures are "disproportionate" and undermine an open Internet.

Among the most recommended options is using a VPN, such as Surfshark, which helps bypass the block by establishing a connection through an external network. [^2]

## **Cloudflare’s Response**

In response, Cloudflare has decided to go on the offensive and has filed a lawsuit against LaLiga. The company argues that the blocking measures are "disproportionate" and undermine an open Internet. In an official statement shared with Teknófilo, Cloudflare explained its position and announced that it has taken the matter to court to overturn the ruling that allowed these massive blocks.

> As a long-time advocate of an open Internet, Cloudflare provides security and reliability services that protect millions of websites from cyberattacks and strengthen Internet infrastructure. In recent weeks, LaLiga and Spanish ISPs have mistakenly attempted to address the problem of illegal streaming, based on a recently issued court ruling that allegedly orders the blocking of shared IP addresses from Cloudflare and other cloud service providers. This clumsy and ineffective approach has prevented millions of users from accessing thousands of websites unrelated to such activities. [^3]

## **The Future of Internet Access**

The lawsuit raises an important debate about balancing copyright protection with preserving open access to the Internet. While some argue that stopping illegal streaming is necessary to protect commercial interests, others believe that the current strategy of mass blocking compromises the essence of the web, affecting innocent users and businesses. The outcome of this dispute could have significant repercussions not only in Spain but also internationally, defining the boundaries and responsibilities of ISPs and copyright holders in the fight against piracy.

### **Conclusion**

Cloudflare’s lawsuit against LaLiga highlights the need to find a balance between copyright protection and open Internet access. The resolution of this conflict will be crucial in determining how future anti-piracy measures are implemented while ensuring that legitimate users and businesses are not harmed in the process.
