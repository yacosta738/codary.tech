The cryptocurrency platform Bybit has fallen victim to a massive heist, considered the largest in cryptocurrency history. According to reports, hackers managed to steal approximately $1.5 billion in Ethereum tokens, surpassing the $611 million stolen from Poly Network in 2021 [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5].

### Attack Details

The attack took place on Friday, February 21, 2025, when a hacker took control of one of Bybit’s cold Ethereum wallets. This wallet contained approximately $1.46 billion in assets, which were transferred through a series of suspicious transactions [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5]. Research firm Arkham Intelligence confirmed that the funds began moving to new addresses where they are now being sold.

### Impact and Bybit’s Response

Ben Zhou, Bybit’s CEO, conducted a live stream on the social network X to reassure customers. He stated that the platform has secured bridge loans from partners and has already obtained about 80% of the necessary funds to cover the loss. Additionally, Bybit is taking legal action to recover the stolen funds [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5].

### Investigation and Attribution

Preliminary investigations suggest that the North Korean-sponsored Lazarus Group may be behind the attack. This group has a history of cryptocurrency theft, including a major attack on the Axie Infinity video game in 2022. Security firm Fireblocks, assisting Bybit with the investigation, has indicated that the attack resembles previous North Korean-linked incidents, pointing to a highly sophisticated attacker [^3].

### Market Repercussions

The heist has had a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. The value of Ether dropped nearly 8% from its daily high, and other cryptocurrencies also experienced declines. Bitcoin, for instance, lost nearly 5% of its value [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5].

### Security Measures and Future Outlook

This incident has reignited the debate over security in centralized exchanges and the need for stronger measures to protect user funds. Founded in 2018, Bybit is one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, with an average daily trading volume of $36 billion [^1] [^2] [^3] [^4] [^5].
